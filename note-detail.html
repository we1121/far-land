        <p>
          Traveling through Europe has always been a dream for many, but the misconception that it requires a fortune
          often holds people back. I'm here to tell you that with careful planning and smart choices, you can explore
          multiple European countries with a budget of just $10,000.
        </p>

        <h3>Planning Your Route</h3>
        <p>
          The key to budget travel in Europe is planning an efficient route. I started my journey in Portugal, then made
          my way through Spain, France, Italy, and ended in Greece. By traveling in a logical sequence, I minimized
          transportation costs and maximized my time in each location.
        </p>

        <h3>Accommodation Hacks</h3>
        <p>
          Instead of expensive hotels, I opted for a mix of hostels, budget guesthouses, and occasional Airbnb stays. In
          some cities, I found hostels for as little as $20 per night, while private rooms in guesthouses averaged
          around $50-70. The best part? Many included breakfast, which saved me additional meal costs.
        </p>

        <h3>Transportation Tips</h3>
        <p>
          For long distances, I used a combination of budget airlines and trains. Booking flights well in advance saved
          me hundreds of dollars. Within cities, I either walked or used public transportation, which is excellent in
          most European cities. In some cases, I purchased city passes that included unlimited public transport and
          entry to major attractions.
        </p>

        <h3>Food and Dining</h3>
        <p>
          One of the joys of traveling through Europe is experiencing the diverse cuisines. To keep costs down, I ate
          breakfast at my accommodation when included, had picnic lunches with items from local markets, and splurged
          occasionally on dinner at local restaurants. Street food also proved to be both delicious and economical.
        </p>

        <h3>Must-Visit Budget-Friendly Destinations</h3>
        <p>
          While cities like Paris and Rome are incredible, they can be expensive. I found amazing value in places like
          Porto (Portugal), Valencia (Spain), Bologna (Italy), and Thessaloniki (Greece). These cities offer rich
          cultural experiences, stunning architecture, and delicious food at a fraction of the cost of their more famous
          counterparts.
        </p>

        <p>
          With careful planning and smart choices, my three-month European adventure cost just under $10,000, including
          flights, accommodation, food, transportation, and activities. The memories and experiences I gained are
          priceless, proving that you don't need unlimited funds to explore the wonders of Europe.
